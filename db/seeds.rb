# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
ResponseDatum.create(uuid: 'X45D6708')
ResponseDatum.create(uuid: 'D7766R98')
