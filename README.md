# README

## The Project: 
The project should take multiple addresses or geocoordinates, convert the addresses to coordinates, so that an optimized delivery route can be retrieved, via the developer here API.

## Run the project

clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/bwittenberg79/code_challenge.git```
run ```bundle install```
run ```rails s```

*there is not much to run I did a ton of second guessing and restarting this, and deleting repositories, so silly, cause I got much closer on two other versions.

- my model validation tests are passing while I only sketched out the tests for the 3rd party api model
- I never got to the controllers on this go around so you cannot make any reasonable requests at this time
